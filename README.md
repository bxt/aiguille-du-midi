# aiguille-du-midi

This repository contains some experiments I did with using a MIDI controller on a JavaScript web page to build cool things.

The pages are built using [vite](https://vite.dev) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com).

> The [Aiguille du Midi](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiguille_du_Midi) is a very cool-looking mountain in the French Alps. It happens to be the highest place I've ever been to in my life. Conveniently, the name also contains the letters “MIDI,” making it the perfect namesake for this repository. ⸺ bxt, Okt 2025
